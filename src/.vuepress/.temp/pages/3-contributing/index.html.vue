<p>Hey! ðŸ‘‹</p>
<p>We're super excited that you want to help out with CardinalKit! We're currently a relatively small team hoping to make a big impact on the digital health community. Our technical stack is primarily composed of Swift and relies on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/health-fitness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HealthKit<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> and <a href="https://www.researchandcare.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResearchKit<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> open source libraries. Their home pages are a great place to start gaining a better understanding of the type of problems we're trying to build for.</p>
<p>There is currently a <a href="https://github.com/CardinalKit/CardinalKit/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feature list<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> which we've compiled here on Github. If you have any additions you would like to make to it, please feel free to add them!</p>
<p>Some action times to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you already know what you want to work on, fork our <a href="https://github.com/cardinalkit/cardinalkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CardinalKit repository<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> and create the changes you want to see.</li>
<li>If you're not sure what to work on or feel that you need some guidance, either browse our <a href="https://github.com/CardinalKit/CardinalKit/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feature list<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> and find something you're passionate about or let us know! We would be more than happy to help you find a project that matches your skill level and goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out!</p>
<p>The CardinalKit Team ðŸŽ‰</p>
