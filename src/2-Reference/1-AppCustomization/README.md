# App Customization Guide

Note: these features are currently only available on the currently experimental swiftui branch of the CardinalKit repository

CardinalKit provides quick customization options for your health research application through the CKConfiguration.plist file. This file is a spreadsheet that maps CardinalKit-defined keys to user-selected values. This reference shows you how to customize that file to suit your needs. Every key must have a value or the app will crash.

The default CardinalKit sample app with no CKConfiguration.plist changes.
