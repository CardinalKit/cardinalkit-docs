## Introduction to CardinalKit

CardinalKit is a free and open-source framework for building modern, interoperable digital health applications for research or clinical care designed to minimize the time and effort needed to get your cloud-connected mobile app up and running by providing you pre-built, open-source template apps on both iOS and Android, as well as reusable code libraries and tools for building custom digital health apps and working with mobile health data.

CardinalKit's template applications can be used as a starting point to build your own digital health app. Our templates include an onboarding & consent process, scheduled tasks, standardized patient surveys, and health data collection from wearables and connected medical devices. CardinalKit also provides a web dashboard which allows researchers and clinicians to view and analyze data collected from study participants and patients.

CardinalKit has been used to build many real-world digital health projects including research studies, clinical care applications, and consumer health products. Our team is made up of clinicians, researchers, and engineers. The broader CardinalKit digital health community spans many universities and countries! CardinalKit is also used as an educational tool in Stanford Biodesign's Building for Digital Health Course, among others.
