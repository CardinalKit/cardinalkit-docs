## Introduction to CardinalKit

::: tip
We recommend that all new projects on iOS use [Stanford Spezi](https://spezi.stanford.edu), our modular and standards-based digital health framework. Check out the [Spezi Template Application](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/SpeziTemplateApplication) as a great way to get started!
:::

CardinalKit is a free and open-source framework for building modern, interoperable digital health applications for research or clinical care designed to minimize the time and effort needed to get your cloud-connected mobile app up and running by providing you pre-built, open-source template apps on both iOS and Android, as well as reusable code libraries and tools for building custom digital health apps and working with mobile health data.

CardinalKit's template applications can be used as a starting point to build your own digital health app. Our templates include an onboarding & consent process, scheduled tasks, standardized patient surveys, and health data collection from wearables and connected medical devices.
